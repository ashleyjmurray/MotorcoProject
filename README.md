Questions:

Can we even use mice to impute missing values because >5% of some variables are missing? (How strict is that cutoff?)

What is the error we're getting with backwards selection?

In Regression Analysis, we would usually do backwards selection and then check VIF to test for multicollinearity, does it still make sense to do it in this order?
